## Project Overview

Sudal is a modern social quiz platform that allows users to create, share, and participate in quizzes on various topics. The platform is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and follows clean architecture principles.

## Architecture Summary

The project follows a clean architecture approach with a feature-centric structure. Each feature is organized with the following components:

- **Domain:** Core business entities and rules.
- **Application:** Use cases orchestrating the flow of data.
- **Interfaces:** Adapters connecting the application to external elements (Handlers, Repository Interfaces).

The following components are independent from features:

- **Infrastructure:** Concrete implementations for databases, external services, logging, configuration, etc.
- **API:** Defined using Protocol Buffers (`.proto`) and served via connect-go.

The codebase is organized into the following directories:

- `/cmd`: Application entry points
- `/internal`: Private application code
- `/pkg`: Public library code
- `/api`: Protocol definition files (Connect/gRPC)
- `/configs`: Configuration files
- `/scripts`: Build and utility scripts
- `/docs`: Documentation files
- `/test`: Additional test utilities

## API Framework

The backend uses Connect-go framework for API development, which supports both gRPC and HTTP/JSON protocols with a single implementation. APIs are defined using Protocol Buffers (`.proto` files) and served via Connect-go handlers.

### Protocol Buffers and JSON Serialization

When using Protocol Buffers with Connect-go, be aware of the following JSON serialization behaviors:

- **Enum Values**: Protobuf enum values are serialized to JSON using their full enum name. For example, an enum value defined as `SERVING_STATUS_SERVING` in the `.proto` file will appear as the string `"SERVING_STATUS_SERVING"` in JSON responses, not as a shortened form like `"SERVING"`.
- **Field Names**: Protobuf field names are converted to camelCase in JSON (e.g., `user_id` becomes `userId`).
- **Default Values**: Fields with default values are typically omitted from JSON output unless explicitly configured otherwise.

These behaviors should be considered when writing client code that consumes the API or when writing tests that verify API responses.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or higher
- Make

### Installation

1. Initialize the development environment:
   ```bash
   make init
   ```

2. Run the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

## Development Setup

### Environment Setup

1. **Go:** Version 1.22 or higher required.
2. **Dependencies:** Managed using Go Modules. Run `make init` or `go mod download`.
3. **Tools:**
   - `golangci-lint` for linting (install via `make install-tools` or manually).
   - `ginkgo` for BDD-style testing (install via `make install-tools` or manually).
   - `mockgen` for generating mocks (install via `make install-tools` or manually).
   - `buf` (optional but recommended for Protobuf management).
   - `protoc-gen-go`, `protoc-gen-connect-go` (for code generation from `.proto`).

### Make Commands

The following `make` commands are available for development:

- `make help`: Display available commands and descriptions.
- `make init`: Initialize the development environment (e.g., install tools).
- `make install-tools`: Install development tools (golangci-lint, ginkgo, mockgen).
- `make build`: Compile the main server application into the `./bin/` directory.
- `make lint`: Run the `golangci-lint` checks.
- `make test`: Run all unit and integration tests (runs preparation steps only once).
- `make test.prepare`: Prepare for running tests (format, vet, lint, generate code).
- `make test.unit`: Run unit tests with preparation steps.
- `make test.int`: Run integration tests with preparation steps.
- `make test.e2e`: Run end-to-end tests with preparation steps.
- `make clean`: Remove build artifacts and caches.
- `make generate`: Run all code generation tasks (mocks, test suites, proto).
- `make run`: Run the application using Docker Compose with `docker-compose up --build`.

## Testing

The project has three types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test the entire system with a running server

To run all tests:

```bash
make test
```

For detailed information about testing, including:
- Running specific test types
- Test structure and organization
- Testing strategy and tools
- Writing BDD tests with Ginkgo
- End-to-end testing

See the [Testing Documentation](docs/test.md).

## Configuration

Sudal uses a flexible configuration system that supports different environments through environment variables and configuration files.

### Quick Start for Local Development

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root (copy from `.env.example`):
   ```
   SERVER_PORT=8080
   LOG_LEVEL=debug
   ENVIRONMENT=development
   # See .env.example for all available options
   ```

2. **Run with Docker Compose** (recommended):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Or run directly** with the configuration file:
   ```bash
   ./bin/server --config=./configs/config.yaml
   ```

### Documentation

For detailed configuration instructions, including:
- Environment-specific configuration guides
- Required parameters and their descriptions
- Cloud Run deployment examples
- Secret management

See the [Configuration Documentation](docs/configuration.md).

## Logging

Sudal uses structured JSON logging via the `zap` library for optimal performance and observability.

### Log Format

All logs are output in JSON format with the following standard fields:

- `timestamp`: ISO8601-formatted timestamp of the log event
- `level`: Log severity level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`)
- `message`: The log message
- `caller`: File and line number where the log was called
- `trace_id`: Unique identifier for request tracing (automatically generated for each request)
- `user_id`: User identifier (when available in authenticated contexts)

For error-level logs, a `stacktrace` field is automatically included with the full call stack.


The default log level is `info` if not specified.

### Usage in Code

The logging package provides context-aware logging functions:

```go
// Standard logging
log.Debug("Debug message", zap.String("key", "value"))
log.Info("Info message", zap.Int("count", 42))
log.Error("Error occurred", zap.Error(err))

// Context-aware logging (preferred)
log.InfoContext(ctx, "Processing request", zap.String("item_id", id))
log.ErrorContext(ctx, "Failed to process request", zap.Error(err))
```
